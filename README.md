## Installation
1. Make sure Poetry and Python 3.8 or later are installed
2. Run the command `poetry install` in the root folder of this repository
3. If that worked as expected, you can now start the application by running the command `poetry run python src/main.py`

## How to use
The demo application currently has two different views, which can be entered by pressing 1 or 2. In both of them, the control points of the BÃ©zier curves can be moved by dragging them with the mouse.

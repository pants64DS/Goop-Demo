# Testing

The following things are tested with unit tests:
* Curve intersections, including all edge cases
* Curve clipping
* Loop turning angles
* Determining if a point is inside a loop (again, including all edge cases)
* The `Vector` class, to make sure the types are determined properly, among other things

The rest of the program, including the merging of loops, is better tested visually. See the [User Guide](doc/User%20Guide.md) for details.

## Running tests
Unit tests can be run by running the command
```
poetry run pytest src
```
in the root directory of this repo.

## Generating a coverage report
A coverage report can be generated by running
```
poetry run coverage run --branch -m pytest src
```
and then
```
poetry run coverage html
```
in the root directory of this repo. The generated report can be viewed by opening `htmlcov/index.html` in a browser.
